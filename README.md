## Description <a name="description"></a>
A CLI application that produces simple logos. You may choose between circles, squares, and triangles, with up to three characters inscribed, and the colors of the shap and the text are fully customizable.

## Installation <a name="installation"></a>
To install this application, download it, and then run "npm i" in your terminal to install the necessary modules. 

## Usage <a name="usage"></a>
Once you have installed the modules, run "node index.js" to start the application. You will be prompted to select a shape, a color for the shape, then input text, and a color for the text. If more than three characters are inputted for the text, the logo will not be generated. Once you have answered all the prompts, a message will appear stating that the .svg file has been created. Navigate to the dist folder to find your .svg file, named after the shape you chose. For a demonstration, see this [link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/17N5BqngwHhSatpEoy8qarpP6QyufNyVv/view).
